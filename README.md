# Model Comparison on Heart Disease Predictions

> The goal of this project is to gain further insight into linear models by taking the math of the representation/evaluation/optimization and programming it. The performance comparisons will be tested on a heart disease dataset obtained from (Kaggle)[https://kaggle.com] and created in parts from statlog and cleveland clinic. Further experimentation on models include more advanced methods such as gradient descent, bagging/boosting, & probabilistic interpretations.
