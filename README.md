*Linear Models & SVM applied to Health Dataset*

**See PDF for official write-up**

# Introduction

The purpose of this project is to both increase our knowledge of the implementations of linear models, support vector machine, and gradient descent, while applying them to a real world dataset. 

Our choice of dataset is a heart disease csv found on Kaggle, which is a cumulation of three different health organization's data. Features included age, gender, resting heart rate, resting blood pressure, as well as numerous other nomial features, and a binary target feature indicating if that patient had heart disease.
